Description
---------------

DiamondQuest is built in the tradition of command-line 
games like Nethack. In this, you answer math problems 
to dig down, and you find various buried treasures. 
Can you beat your high score? This game was built by 
Jason C. McDonald for a very special friend, but 
you can enjoy it too!
