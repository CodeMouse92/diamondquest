# DiamondQuest

A platformer about digging for treasure using *math* drills! It's inspired by
16-bit platformers.

DiamondQuest is an **accessibility-first** platformer, designed to be fun and
completely playable by players with motor disabilities affecting their use of
the mouse or keyboard. There is no "death condition", and no need to worry about
reflexes or tricky combinations: the entire game is playable with *one finger*
on the keyboard, or with a head pointer.

DiamondQuest is also a **math practice game** that coaches you while you solve
math problems. Problem difficulty is determined primarily by how deep you dig,
but the deeper you go, the rarer and more valuable the treasures get.

While most math games try to make practice fun by adding timers and urgency,
DiamondQuest instead gives you all the time you need to solve problems at your
own pace. There's no timers and no way to lose. The more you challenge
yourself, the greater the rewards are!

Featuring original retro graphics, intuitive gameplay, and a relaxing ambient
soundtrack, **DiamondQuest** will challenge everything you ever thought you knew
about platformer games. Get ready for the most fun you've ever had with math.
